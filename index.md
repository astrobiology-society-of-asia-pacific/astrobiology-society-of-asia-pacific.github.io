Attendees of the original "Astrobiology in Asia" meeting at AbSciCon 2019 showed enthusiasm about (1) promoting astrobiology in their home countries or in the Asia-Pacific countries where their current affiliations are located; (2) the idea of having a regional meeting equivalent to AbSciCon; and (3) the idea of having an organization to facilitate the above activities. They reconvened to discuss steps going forward. Here is <a href="/pdfs/AbSciCon_AsiaPacific_20190628_v2.pdf" target="_blank">a short summary</a>.
